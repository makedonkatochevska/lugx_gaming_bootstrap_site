## Project Description 📜

This project is a complete redesign of a gaming website using **Bootstrap**, **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The website follows a **mobile-first approach** and features a fully responsive layout to ensure an optimal user experience across all devices.

The site is built from a template originally designed by **Templatemo.com**, and it has been customized to fit the gaming niche. It includes four pages, a sticky navigation bar, form validation using custom JavaScript, and a modern, sleek design.

This redesign not only showcases the power of **Bootstrap** in quickly developing a fully functional, responsive layout but also integrates **JavaScript** for custom form validation and the sticky navbar functionality.
